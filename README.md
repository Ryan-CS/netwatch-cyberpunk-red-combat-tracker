# netwatch-cyberpunk-red-combat-tracker
A browser-based combat and session tracker for Cyberpunk RED. Designed for GMs, this tool manages initiative, HP, armor, damage resolution, critical injuries, ammo, notes, and character art, with undo/redo, drag-and-drop turn order, session save/load, and a read-only player view. Runs entirely client-side with no dependencies or server required.
